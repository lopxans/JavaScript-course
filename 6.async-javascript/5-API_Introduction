1. What is API?
- Api stand for Application Pragramming Interface.
- It's a way for different software or apps to talk to each other and share information or services.

- Think of it as a translator or messenger.
    Exaple:
    It's like a waiter in a resaurant.
    You (app) tell the waiter (API) what food you want, and the waiter goes to the kitchen(server), brins it back, and serves you.

2. Why do we need APIs?
- Communication: Apps talk to each other through APIs.
- Save Time: Instead of building everything from scratch, use existing services.
- Example: Google Maps API lets apps like Uber show maps without coding maps themselves.

3. Real-Life examples of APIs
- Weather Apps: Use APIs to fetch real-time weather updates.
- Payment Gateways: Use APIs for transactions (like Razorpay, PayPal).
- Social Media: login with Facebook/Google? That's an API at work.

4. How does an API work?
- Request: Your app sends a message to the API (e.g./ "Give me weacther for Kathmandu").
- Processing: The API talks to the server and gets the data.
- Response: The API sends the data back to your app.

5. Types of APIs
- Web APIs: Access through the internet (REST APIs).
- Library APIs: For coding libraries like NumPy or Pandas.
- Operating System APIs: Control hardware feature like camera or microphone.

6. REST APIs in Web APIs
- REST APIs (Representational State Transfer):
- A popular and widely-used architectural style for Web APIs.
- Operates over HTTP with starndard methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- Return data typically in JSON or XML format.

    Example in JavaScript:
    fetch('https://api.example.com/weather?city=Kathmandu')
        .then(response => response.json)
        .then(data => console.log(data));

7. Other Types of Web APIs
*   Allthough REST APIs are dominant, Web APIs aslo include:

- GraphQl APIs: 
    * Query-based APIs allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need.
    * More frexible than REST APIs.

- SOAP APIs: 
    * Older protocol that uses XML for communication.
    * Known for string security and reliablity but is more complex.

- Browser APIs: 
    * Built into web browsers, allowing interaction with the browser's functionality.
    * Examplse: DOM API(manipulate web page content) & Geolocation API(get user's location).

- Streaming APIs: 
    * Used for real-time data delivery (e.g., WebSockets).

8. Benefits of APIs
- Scalable: Share only the necessay data.
- Secure: Access without exposing sensitive info.
- Reusable: Use the same API for different apps.


Summary:
- APIs are the bidge between apps and servers.
- They make apps smarter and more connected.
- You interact with APIs daily, even without knowing it!
